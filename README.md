# odin-recipes
Practice project for the Odin project

The primary goal is to practice using git and github.

The order of a git commit is:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push




# A simple recipe website

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.  


# Recipes

- Lasagna
- Spaghetti
- Tacos 


It seems Cursor is familiari with the project already. It  is auto generating the content for this page. Perhaps even for the recipes.
